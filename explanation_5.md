### Explanation problem 5 : Blockchain

There are two ways to solve this problem. Create blocks and append one on another or create linked list and append 
blocks in list. Using linked list, I have initialized head and tail where head is first block or starting block of list 
and tail is last block or last element of list.

Time complexity for appending a block is `O(1)` and space complexity is `O(n)` which is total space that is occupied 
by blockchain.

### Explanation problem 6 : Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

For this problem, first I created a set for making union & intersection of the two linked list. Then I have created a 
new linked list (LinkedList object) from that set.


Time complexity for union is `O(n)` and space complexity is `O(n)`.

Time complexity for intersection is `O(n)` and space complexity is `O(n)`.
